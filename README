Compilation
===========

If you haven't done so already, make sure that all submodules are up-to-date:

  git submodule update --init

Create a build directory (e.g., ./build), change into it and type

  cmake [path_to_sopnet_directory (e.g. '..')]

cmake will try to find the required packages and tell you, which ones are missing. All packages except for the vigra library can be installed using the default Ubuntu repositories.

To get a recent version of vigra, perform the following steps:

Vigra
-----

  Get vigra from

    git clone git://github.com/ukoethe/vigra.git

  or

    http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/vigra-1.8.0-src.tar.gz

  and build it
  (http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/doc/vigra/Installation.html). Set the
  Vigra_BUILD_DIR to the  directory where you built it.

After cmake finished without errors, run

  make
